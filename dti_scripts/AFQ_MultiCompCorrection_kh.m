% Compute a multiple comparison correction for Tract Profile data
%
%   [alphaFWE statFWE clusterFWE] = AFQ_MultiCompCorrection(data,y,alpha, method)
%
% There are 2 multiple comparison corrections implemented. Both account for
% the correlation structure in the data but in different ways.
%
% method = 'permutation' (default)
% This is an implementation of the permutation method described by Nichols
% and Holmes (2001). Nonparametric permutation tests for functional
% neuroimaging: A primer with examples. Human Brain Mapping.  This will
% return the faily wise error (FWE) corrected alpha value for pointwise
% comparisons.  It will also compute the FWE corrected cluster size at the
% user defined alpha.  This means that significant clusters of this size or
% greater are pass the multiple comparison threshold and do not need 
% further p-value adjustment.
%
% method = 'chevrud'
% This is an implementation of the multiple comparison correction proposed
% in Cheverud, J. M. (2001). A simple correction for multiple comparisons
% in interval mapping genome scans. Heredity (Edinb), 87(Pt 1), 52-58.  It
% calculates the number of independent variables in a dataset based on the
% varience in the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix for the data.  For
% Tract Diffusionp Profiles, values at nearby nodes are highly correlated
% and should not be treated as independent variables.  By taking into
% account the correlation between values at multiple points and on multiple
% tracts this alogorithm will determine a much more reasonable multiple
% comparison correction than the typical, overly conservative bonferroni
% correction
%
% Inputs:
% data     = Either a matrix of data for a single tract, or a matrix of data
%            for all the tracts combined.
% y        = A vector of either behavioral measurements or a binary 
%            grouping variable for which pointwise statistics will be
%            computed on the Tract Profile and the p-value adjusted for
%            mulltiple comparisons will be determined.  If y is a
%            continuous variable the correlations will be computed. If y is
%            a binary vector then T-tests will be computed.
% alpha    = The desired alpha (pvalue) to adjust
% method   = 'permutation' or 'chevrud'. We strongly recomend 'permutation'
%
% Outputs:
% alphaFWE   = This is the alpha (p value) that corresponds after adjustment 
%              for multiple comparisons
% statFWE    = This is the value of the statistic corresponding to alphaFWE.
%              statFWE will either be a correlation coeficient or T-statistic
% clusterFWE = Clusters of points on a Tract Profile that are larger than
%              clusterFWE are significant at pvalue = alpha.
% stats      = A structure containing the results of each permutation
%
% Example:
%
% % Get a matrix of Tract FA Profile values for all the tracts
% data = AFQ_get(afq,'all vals', 'fa');
% % Compute the corrected p-value for ttests along the tract
% [alphaFWE statFWE] = AFQ_MultiCompCorrection(data,sub_group,0.05)
