      <p>As discussed in the New &amp; Notes (May, 2003) article <b>Using Visualization Techniques for Batch Condition Monitoring</b>, Multi-way PCA is one of the statistical techniques that is used for analyzing batch processes. By a "batch" process, we
         mean an industrial process, such as manufacturing a product, that goes through a pre-defined cycle and has a definite beginning
         and end. These processes are designed to be time varying: several inputs are added, knobs are turned, and conditions altered
         through-out its run to convert raw materials into a final product.
      </p>
      <p>For a typical batch process, the measurements of all the relevant process variables - temperature, pressure, power consumption
         etc are recorded over the course of its run. These datasets tend to be very large and are accumulated over long periods of
         time for several runs. Because of the size of these datasets, it is not easy to analyze them or present them directly to make
         judgments about the performance (quality) of the process. Several  statistical techniques have been developed to extract useful
         information from these datasets, and effectively, perform a data compression. Multi-way PCA is one of them.

      <p>Now we come to the most interesting part: prognostics. The analysis described above is most beneficial if it could be performed
         WHILE A BATCH IS RUNNING. If the condition of a batch can be forecasted in advance, then a control action (correction) can
         be applied to correct a possible faulty behavior. This could save a lot of costs and reduce wastage of resources.
      </p>
      <p>However, the Multi-way PCA approach, as described above, cannot be applied directly since the computation of scores requires
         the data for entire batch history. Since each measurement of every process variable has to be treated independently (distinct),
         we cannot estimate the unknown values in the middle of a running batch, using the measurements available until that time.
         What we can do instead, is assume a <b>distribution</b> for the variance of the unmeasured variables.
      </p>
      <p>So suppose a completed batch data vector has 100 elements. Half-way through the batch (<tt>t=T/2</tt>), we would have measured 50 of these, while the rest 50 elements are unknown at the current time. Assuming that the unmeasured
         ones have a Gaussian distribution (after normalization), we can compute the mean and covariance of the score coordinates.
         This was, an incomplete running batch would map to a <b>region</b> in the Principal Component Space, rather than a single point.
      </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE:</b> Let us see how this works out for the "good data" batch (variable called 'gooddata', that was loaded earlier). The entire
         data vector was represented by a blue dot in the PC plane. Now suppose that at a time <tt>t=T/3</tt> (one third through the process), we wanted to forecast where the score for this batch is going to be located. Since we have
         only one third of the data set available, we can only guess a "region" where the score will probably be end up at the completion
         of the batch. Here's how we visualize this region:

      <p>Using the Camera Orbit tool, it is easy to see that the blue ellipsoid is completely inside the in-control region. For process
         control, this means that an operator can deduce that the running batch (which is 1/3rd complete till now) will most likely
         end up similar to the calibration batches.
      </p>
      <p>The red ellipsoid (corresponding to the faulty data) is completely disjointed from the in-control region. This indicates that
         it is very unlikely that this batch would end up being normal. Thus if the running batch corresponded to the red ellipsoid,
         an operator should take appropriate corrective action so that at the next measurement instant, the red ellipsoid is actually
         inside the in-control region.

%% Introduction: What is a Batch Process and what is Multi-Way PCA?

%

% Here |t| is time vector; |udat| is a 3-D matrix containing measurements
% of 12 variables at 95 time instants each for 37 calibration (good)
% batches.
%
% Now, unfold the data for each batch into a vector and normalize all

%%

%%
% As seen from the figure, we can choose 3 to 5 components for our PCA
% model. Here, we use 3 components to build up a 3-D PC space:
%
Pc = P(1:3,:); % first 3 direction vectors

%%
% *STEP 2*: Analysis of a particular batch: Is it similar to calibration
% batches or different?
%
% First, we define a region of acceptable variability (also called
% in-control region). Let us say that the region containing 95% of the
% points corresponding to the 37 calibration batches is an acceptable
% region, meaning, if a particular batch is in this region, we say it is a
% good batch. 
%
%%
% Map the calibration batches onto the PC space:
mapped_calib_data = umat*Pc.'; %3 coordinates for 37 batches in a 
                               %37 x 3 matrix; coordinates are called
                               %"scores".
%%
% Now we generate a surface containing two standard deviations for the
% "good" scores represented by mapped_calib_data. Assuming a Gaussian
% distribution, we can generate an ellipsoidal surface using the mean and
% covariance information as follows:

%%
% Calculate mean and covariance of this data:
M = mean(mapped_calib_data);
C = cov(mapped_calib_data);

%%
% Genarate the 95% confidence region ellipsoid:
[x,y,z] = compute_ellipsoid(M,C); % Find function COMPUTE_ELLIPSOID.M in the demo package
%%
% (|x, y, z|) are the points on the surface of the 95% confidence
% ellipsoid. We can visualize this region as follows:

% As observed, the good batch maps to a location inside the ellipsoid,
% while a faulty or irregular batch leads to a mapping away from
% the ellipsoid. Using this technique a process engineer can quickly
% decide whether a test batch was normal or faulty.

%% PROGNOSTICS: Deciding the process behavior IN ADVANCE
%
% Now we come to the most interesting part: prognostics. The analysis
% described above is most beneficial if it could be performed WHILE A BATCH
% IS RUNNING. If the condition of a batch can be forecasted in advance,
% then a control action (correction) can be applied to correct a possible
% faulty behavior. This could save a lot of costs and reduce wastage of
% resources. 
%
% However, the Multi-way PCA approach, as described above, cannot be
% applied directly since the computation of scores requires the data for
% entire batch history. Since each measurement of every process variable
% has to be treated independently (distinct), we cannot estimate the
% unknown values in the middle of a running batch, using the measurements
% available until that time. What we can do instead, is assume a
% *distribution* for the variance of the unmeasured variables.  
%
% So suppose a completed batch data vector has 100 elements. Half-way
% through the batch (|t=T/2|), we would have measured 50 of these, while the
% rest 50 elements are unknown at the current time. Assuming that the
% unmeasured ones have a Gaussian distribution (after normalization), we
% can compute the mean and covariance of the score coordinates. This was,
% an incomplete running batch would map to a *region* in the Principal
% Component Space, rather than a single point. 

%%
% *EXAMPLE:* Let us see how this works out for the "good data" batch (variable
% called 'gooddata', that was loaded earlier). The entire data vector was
% represented by a blue dot in the PC plane. Now suppose that at a time
% |t=T/3| (one third through the process), we wanted to forecast where the
% score for this batch is going to be located. Since we have only one third
% of the data set available, we can only guess a "region" where the score
% will probably be end up at the completion of the batch. Here's how we
% visualize this region:
%
%%
available_data =  gooddata(1:38); % only 1/3 of total data is available
%
% Compute the covariance of the training (calibration data), re-distributed
% along the first 3 directions.
% This will take a few seconds...

L1 = L(1:3); L1 = L1(:);
n = size(P,1);
L2 = ((sum(L)-sum(L1))/(n-3))*ones(n-3,1);
newL = [L1;L2];
S = P*diag(newL)*P.';

% Partition the covariance information: 
S11 = S(1:38,1:38);
S12 = S(1:38,39:end);
S21 = S(39:end,1:38);
S22 = S(39:end,39:end);

W1 = P(1:3,1:38);
W2 = P(1:3,39:end);

% Compute the score mean and covariance
score_mean =  (W1+W2*S21*inv(S11))*available_data.';
score_cov = W2*(S22-S21*inv(S11)*S12)*W2.';
%

%%
% Now we visualize the the score region the same way we visualized the
% in-control ellipsoid:

[xd,yd,zd] = compute_ellipsoid(score_mean,score_cov); %
%
f1 = figure('pos',[0.4555,0.3740,0.5086,0.5166],'color','w');

%% Making Useful Conclusions from this Visualization
% Using the Camera Orbit tool, it is easy to see that the blue
% ellipsoid is completely inside the in-control region. For process
% control, this means that an operator can deduce that the running
% batch (which is 1/3rd complete till now) will most likely end up
% similar to the calibration batches. 
% 
% The red ellipsoid (corresponding to the faulty data) is completely
% disjointed from the in-control region. This indicates that it is very
% unlikely that this batch would end up being normal. Thus if the
% running batch corresponded to the red ellipsoid, an operator should
% take appropriate corrective action so that at the next measurement
% instant, the red ellipsoid is actually inside the in-control region.
